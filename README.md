# Melanoma-Classification-with-Attention

This notebook was published in the [SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification) Competition on Kaggle.
> I have used attention mechanism presented in [this paper](https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/~hamarneh/ecopy/ipmi2019.pdf) with VGG-16 to help the model learn relevant parts in the images and make it more iterpretable. 

To run the notebook you can download the dataset from these links and place them in their respective folders inside data.
